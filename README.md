# ARDUINO: Small and Mini Projects
Welcome to my Arduino World! This repository showcases a collection of small and mini Arduino activities designed to inspire and learn. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started or an experienced maker seeking new ideas, you'll find something valuable here.


## Projects Included
1. **LED Blink**: to get started with the Arduino!
2. **fade LED**: a simple LED toggle program to change intensities.
3. **Push Button**: to blink the LED when the button is pressed.
4. **Potentiometer**: to change the LED intensity with the help of a potentiometer.
   and many more interesting projects like using ultrasonic sensors and avoiding debounce delay will help progress from a beginner state to the next level.
